                <p>The discourse of another can be mentioned in various ways. Just like geometric shapes, the ways of mentioning another's voice also differ by characteristics and peculiarities (which, in another section, we will demonstrate acting in conjunction with their functionalities in academic text). We will bring you examples of the modalities of <strong>evocation</strong>, <strong>reformulation</strong>, <strong>quotation</strong>, and <strong>citational islet</strong>. In the topic <strong>EXAMPLES</strong> below, these modalities and their applications are better demonstrated for you to understand better.</p>

                <h3>Evocation</h3>
                <div class="TextosFormas">
                    <p>
                        In evocation, only an allusion to works and authors is made, without delving into or paraphrasing their contents, as can be seen in the example.
                    </p><br>
                    <p><strong>“In the end, the volunteer would have to leave their respective opinion by writing the sample number, thus specifying which portion they would buy. The data obtained from the analysis were tabulated and the methodology adopted for the sensory process was that of Grosso (2006).”</strong></p><br>
                    <p>
                        As we can see, an evocation is brought integrated into the grammar of the sentence to allusively justify the sensory process, all of this from the methodology used in the work, without necessarily delving into the characteristics of the adopted methodological process.

                <h3>Reformulation</h3>
                <div class="TextosFormas">
                    <p>
                        In reformulation, as we can see in the example below, the writer incorporates into their own saying the saying of another, interpreting the idea of another and rewriting it in their own words.
                    </p><br>
                    <p><strong>“According to São-Mateus et al., (2013) the remaining areas of Atlantic Forest in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, from the point of view of flora and fauna, have been little studied and consequently reports about the flowers and the biology of solitary bees in these regions are also very scarce.”</strong></p><br>
                    <p>
                        In the example of reformulation exposed, a paraphrase is made - saying in a different way the idea already constructed by another - of the author's speech, considering the thematic essence of their work. In this specific case, the point of view of the cited authors about the lack of studies on flowers and the biology of solitary bees in regions of the Atlantic Forest in the state of Rio Grande do Norte is paraphrased and introduced.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Quotation</h3>
                    <div class="TextosFormas">
                        <p>
                            Quotation occurs in the exact reproduction of another's discourse, thus performing a kind of "ctrl+C" and "ctrl+V" in their original text and an indication of the source of the quoted passage. By using this form, the discourse of another gains a certain autonomy, since it allows it to integrate into the grammar of the new production: whether through quotation marks, italics or typographic blocks.
                        </p><br>
                        <p><strong>“In this new and fascinating research area, some important definitions of what an agent would be emerged, such as the one initially proposed by Wooldridge (1997 apud Jennings, 1999, p.1): ‘An agent is an encapsulated computational system that is situated in some environment, and is capable of autonomous and flexible action in that environment, in order to fulfill its objectives’.”</strong></p><br>
                        <p>
                            Clearly, we see Wooldridge's (1997) idea purely referenced through quotes and page indication.

                <h3>Citational Islet</h3>
                <div class="TextosFormas">
                    <p>
                        The citational islet is defined as an intersection between reformulation and quotation. The discourse of another is synthesized by transcribing expressions that they used in their own production and in the interpretation and reformulation made by the person who references.
                    </p><br>
                    <p><strong>“Probabilistic models differ from the compositional approach, considering that the meaning of an expression is given ‘by the company it keeps,’ that is, the meaning of an expression is given by the contexts in which it occurs (MANNING; SCHÜTZE, 1999).”</strong></p><br>
                    <p>
                        In the excerpt, the composition of the citational islet is given by the passage between quotes (the quotation) and the interpretation that the researcher made of it (through "that is"): which marks the reformulation of Schütze's (1999) idea about the relativity of the meaning of expressions.
